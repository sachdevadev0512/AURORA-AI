"""
Reorder math — pure functions, no I/O.

The Restock tab used to frame reorder dates as "when the seller places a PO
with their supplier", using a coarse per-org lead time. That was wrong for
FBA sellers: they don't manage supplier POs through this app, they manage
what's already in transit to Amazon.

The new model:

  1. Read the seller's current on-hand at FBA.
  2. Walk every in-flight inbound shipment (from Aurora's `shipments`
     collection) — each has an ETA and outstanding units per SKU.
  3. Simulate the stock timeline: start at on_hand today, deplete at the
     forecasted daily demand, add each shipment's outstanding units on its
     ETA. Find the first day the balance hits zero — the `stockout_date`.
  4. Ship-by-air date  = stockout_date − AIR_TRANSIT_DAYS
     Ship-by-ocean date = stockout_date − OCEAN_TRANSIT_DAYS

Ship-by dates are dispatch deadlines — the seller factors in their own
prep/packing time on top. AIR/OCEAN transit constants are the time from
dispatch → arrival at the Amazon FC.

Safety stock is intentionally zero — the seller asked to be alerted at
pure depletion, and the timeline sim already accounts for real inbound.
`recommended_po_qty` targets `target_cover_days` of forward demand net of
what's already inbound.
